% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 12pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[13pt,journal,compsoc,onecolumn]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.





% ARNON ADDITIONS: MATH
\usepackage{amsfonts}

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
   \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
% % %\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{algorithm}% http://ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
\usepackage{algpseudocode}% http://ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx
\usepackage{eqparbox,array}
\renewcommand\algorithmiccomment[1]{%
  \hfill\#\ \eqparbox{COMMENT}{#1}%
}
\newcommand\LONGCOMMENT[1]{%
  \hfill\#\ \begin{minipage}[t]{\eqboxwidth{COMMENT}}#1\strut\end{minipage}%
}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
 \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil

\begin{abstract}
We consider the problem of detecting malicious traffic in high bandwidth links. With the ever increasing bandwidth and traffic, deep packet inspection interferes with throughput and becomes computationally demanding. We developed a learning algorithm based on the well-known universal compression algorithm Lempel-Ziv 78 \cite{Lem78}. We built a proof-of-concept application that emulates a real-world situation and attempts to identify malware. Our algorithm builds a traffic fingerprint for well-known malware using only the time difference between packets. The algorithm then compares the fingerprint against unknown traffic.
We study the effectiveness of our method with real-world malicious traffic.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{C}{yberattacks} are an attempt to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer, computing systems or a network. Cyberattacks can affect a wide range of domains and system and potentially cause tangible damage to lives in case of SCADA networks.

Malware\footnote{Contraction of \textbf{mal}icious soft\textbf{ware}} is a piece of computer software that uses vulnerabilities in computer hardware and software in order to alter the state or function of computers and computer networks without permission (explicit or implicit). Modern malwares depends on communication networks in order to receive commands, coordinate attacks (DDoS), relay information to the attacker and infect new targets.

Detecting malicious traffic in high bandwidth links is a challenging and complicated task. One of more prevalent solutions is deep packet inspection (DPI). DPI scans the entire packet stream, and can be used to identify malware communication in the data section of the packet. The main drawbacks of this approach are the computational power needed to classify the traffic, as well as the difficulty of inspecting encrypted packets. 

A different approach is feature extraction, which attempts to overcome the disadvantage of DPI by extracting a limited number of features from the packet. When performing an analysis over fast data links for an ever growing list of malwares, deciding which features to extract requires copious amounts of memory and computational power.

This research focuses on a different approach for traffic classification, known as traffic fingerprint. This method overcomes some of the disadvantages of the methods described. The solution examines only the time difference between packets.

The learning algorithm represented is based on the well-known universal compression algorithm Lempel-Ziv 78 \cite{Lem78}. A traffic fingerprint is created using the time differences from malware communication. Malware communication events are represented as discrete sequences over small finite alphabet. This sequence is then used for building a Lempel-Ziv 78 tree with a probabilistic prediction model \cite{MFe92}. This modified tree is used as fingerprint for each specific malware and represents the malware behaviour. A similar approach was used when attempting to identify a unique user typing on a computer \cite{Nis03}.
This approach enables us to make fast and accurate decisions without the need for packet analysis.

\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Lempel Ziv 78}
In 1978, Avraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv presented their algorithm for variable-rate compression \cite{Lem78} (LZ78). Their dictionary-based algorithm has been used extensively for compressing many different file types, from images to text and audio.
The LZ78 algorithm is a universal prediction, one pass algorithm. It builds a weighted tree from sequences of a finite alphabet.

The LZ78 tree holds a ‘dictionary’ of phrases parsed from the input text (training) and is constructed incrementally as follows:
Initially, the dictionary is empty. During each step of the algorithm, the smallest prefix of consecutive symbols not yet seen is added to the dictionary. As such, each phrase is unique in the dictionary and it extends a previously seen phrase by one symbol.
For example, the string \emph{'abbacbaccbcabb'} is parsed into the following dictionary entries \emph{a; b; ba; c; bac; cb; ca; bb} (See example in Figure \ref{fig:lztree})

Since each phrase extends a previously seen phrase, they can be ordered in a tree, as described in \cite{Lan83}. In [2] the authors proposed a method for prediction of the next outcome of a sequence using the aforementioned LZ78 tree, by assigning conditional probabilities to each event.

In \cite{Nis03}, an expanded LZ78 tree is used in order to identify the user typing on a computer keyboard. The authors suggested an expansion of the LZ78 tree seen in \cite{Lan83} by using input shifting and back-shift parsing, in order to rectify ‘noisy’ statistics caused by small training sets.

The idea to apply the LZ78 tree prediction method to malware detection was first suggested in \cite{Coh12}. Their idea included using vector quantization on packet time differences in order to predict whether unknown traffic is malicious or not - based on pre-trained sequences.


\subsection{Malware Traffic}
\label{sec:malwaretraffic}
In the past, most malware was in the form of viruses and worms, and was usually distributed physically. In recent years, with the spread of computer networks in general and the internet in particular, most malware now utilizes the internet or a local network for spreading and coordinating actions.

When a virus coordinates actions, it is known as a botnet. Such actions might include distributed attacks (like DDoS\footnote{Distributed denial of service}), personal data gathering, e-mail spam, etc. A botnet usually has a C\&C\footnote{Command and Control} channel that it utilizes for coordinating such attacks.
The C\&C channel is usually obscured by impersonating a well-known protocol to some extent, such as HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443, IRC ports, etc.
The traffic generated by the malware when communicating through the C\&C channel tends to remain consistent \cite{Vil12}.

Cryptolocker is a ransomware trojan which infects Windows based PCs. Usually, the attack begins as an e-mail attachment, after which the Trojan is installed on the PC. When activated, the Trojan encrypts a selection of files on the computer using RSA public-key cryptography with the private key stored on a remote server. The user is then given an ultimatum to pay bitcoins in order to receive the decryption key. If no payment is made by the deadline, the Trojan threatens to erase the key from the server and keep all of the data encrypted.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig1.pdf}
 \caption{Cryptolocker sample conversation list\label{fig:cryptolockerconv}}
\end{figure} 

Examining the Cryptolocker ransomware as a test case, an interesting network traffic profile is revealed. It first arrives via e-mail or other method. Once installed, it begins looking for a server. First, it attempts to access a hard-coded IP 184.164.136.134. If that fails, it generates a pseudo-random URL based on the time of day. This rule is known and allows the operator of the Trojan to pre-register the pseudo-random domain names \cite{EMS13}.

Once a suitable C\&C server has been found, the malware will start to communicate through regular HTTP POST requests (See figure~\ref{fig:cryptolockerconv}), albeit only as a wrapper for RSA encrypted data (See figure~\ref{fig:cryptolockerpacket}).
This behaviour is for the most part constant and was identified in several captures on different times and different machines.

\section{Identifying traffic based on the LZ78 fingerprint}
The core of our application is the LZ78 based fingerprint. Each fingerprint represents the behaviour of one malware capture.
A method for transformation of network behaviour into parsable input sequence must first be described, which in turn will be quantized using a vector-quantization clustering algorithm to be fed into the LZ78 tree creation algorithm.

\subsection{Representation via quantized packet time-difference}
The packet time difference is the time elapsed between to packet arrival/departure events in the same flow. Time difference between packets is defined as 
in (\ref{eq:timediff}) below.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:timediff}
\Delta _i \buildrel \Delta \over = {t_{i + 1}} - {t_i}
\end{equation}
Each stream of length \emph{k} is transformed into a sequence of time differences $\Delta _1, \Delta _2, ..., \Delta _k$
Because $\Delta _i \in \mathbb{R} {^ + }$  is in an infinite range, we wish to reduce the number of time differentials and smooth them over. Thus, vector quantization is performed using K-Means clustering. This enables the use of fewer symbols in the training phase which reduces variance.
\subsection{K-means clustering and K-means++ quantization scheme}
In order to quantize the packet time differences into a string parsable by the LZ78 tree-building algorithm, the K-Means++ algorithm was used.
K-Means clustering, the basis for the K-Means++ algorithm is commonly used to partition a data-set into k groups by selecting k clusters and then refining them iteratively. Since the algorithm is at its base NP-Hard, several algorithms, such as Lloyd-Max are commonly used to converge to an optimal result more quickly.

K-Means++ \cite{Art07} is an algorithm for choosing the initial seed values of the K-Means clustering algorithm first proposed in 2007 by D.~Arthur and S.~Vassilvitskii. It is an approximation algorithm for the NP-Hard K-Means problem, which avoids the sometimes poor clustering found by the Lloyd-Max algorithm.

In the program built, the input for K-Means++ is an observation vector which is all time differences seen during the extraction process described above.
The output for K-Means++ is a list of centroid values.
In order to perform quantization for each malware capture, decision boundaries must first be set. For simplicity, they are set halfway between every two centroids.

 \caption{Packet time difference quantization and letter assignment example\label{fig:packetquant}}
\end{figure} 
\subsection{Classification Methods Examined}
\subsubsection{Chosen method - Smoothed KL Distance}
The \emph{Kullback--Leibler Divergence} is a metric for measuring the distance between two probability measures, defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kld}
D(P||Q) \buildrel \Delta \over = \sum\nolimits_i {\ln ({P_i}/{Q_i}) \cdot {P_i}}
\end{equation}
In the proposed algorithm, each test is composed of two probability models, consisting of discrete probabilities for the fingerprint and the raw capture data. When comparing the two trees on a node-by-node basis --- there could be a case where $Q_i=0$, causing an undefined value.
To counter this case, a modified version called \emph{Smoothed KL Distance} was devised.
The algorithm runs on two trees, where $T_{FP}$ is the fingerprint, while $T_U$ is the unknown capture.
(The trees are built as described in section \ref{section:trainingp})
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Smoothed KL Distance}\label{kld}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{SmoothedKL}{$T_{FP},T_U$}
\State $sum\gets0$
   \ForAll{Node $n_i$ in $T_{FP}$}
      \State $p_i\gets$ probability of node $n_i$
      \If{Exact matching node $m\in T_U$}
      	\State $q_i\gets$ probability of node $m$
      \Else
      	\State $q_i\gets$ probability of closest node in $T_U$ (lexicographically)
      	\State $q_i\gets q_i\cdot\varepsilon$\Comment{$\varepsilon$ is very small}
      \EndIf
   \State$sum\gets 
   $sum+$ \log_k (p_i/q_i) \cdot {p_i}$\Comment{$k$ --- amount of centroids}
   \EndFor\label{euclidendwhile}
   \State \textbf{return} $sum$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsubsection{Methods not chosen - Hamming Loss and Log Loss}
The two techniques Log loss \cite{Bis06} and Hamming loss \cite{Tso07, Ham50} are functions that represent the cost or value of an event, or an error metric.
The error metric is used due to the necessity to predict the time difference for the next packet, based on the context of the time differences seen so far.
Since discrete probabilities have already been assigned for each event, these will be the probabilities that will feature in the loss functions.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ll}
LogLoss =  - \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {[{y_i}\log ({{\hat y}_i}) + (1 - {y_i})\log } (1 - {\hat y_i})]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hl}
HammingLoss({x_i},{y_i}) = \frac{1}{{\left| D \right|}}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{\left| D \right|} {\frac{{xor({x_i},{y_i})}}{{\left| L \right|}}}
\end{equation}
Where $L$ is the number of labels, $D$ is the number of samples, $x_i$ is the prediction and $y_i$ is the ground truth.

In Log loss, the use of the log function on the probability causes extreme punishment for being confident about a wrong prediction.
In Hamming loss, any mismatch between the prediction and the real value will cause a punishment of 1.

  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure} 


A proof-of-concept application was built using Python due to the numerous add-on packages for parsing input files and various mathematical packages. A screenshot of our application is shown in Figure \ref{fig:progscreenshot}.
The program is split into two operating phases: a training phase and a testing phase as seen in Figure \ref{fig:progstruct}.

\subsubsection{Training phase}\label{section:trainingp}
The pre-cleaned malware captures are processed to extract packet time differences.
These time differences are placed in a vector which is then quantized into a user-specified amount of values (centroids) using the K-Means++ algorithm. 
The quantized string is then used to build a LZ78 tree based on the algorithm presented previously. This represents our malware fingerprint\footnote{This action is performed for each malware capture separately}.
The fingerprints are stored in a local malware fingerprint database for easy access.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Training Algorithm}\label{alg:training}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Training}{}
\State ${GV}_O\gets[]; {GV}_C\gets[]$
\State ${Database}\gets[]$
   \ForAll{Capture$_i\gets$Malware captures}
   	\State \Call{Append to}{${GV}_O\gets$[$\Delta_1,\Delta_2,...,\Delta_k$]}
   \EndFor
   \State ${GV}_C\gets$\Call{K-Means++}{${GV}_O$}

   \ForAll{Capture$_i\gets$Malware captures}
   	\State $V_i\gets\Delta_1,\Delta_2,...,\Delta_k$
   	\State Apply quantization transformation $
   	\Delta  \Rightarrow {c^*}$ 
    where ${c^*} = \mathop {\arg \min }\limits_{{c_i}} \left| {\Delta  - {c_i}} \right|$
   	\State Map each quantized value  into a corresponding
   	letter from the Latin alphabet ($a$,$b$,$c$,...)
   	\State ${Tree}_i\gets$\Call{LZ78 Tree Generation}{ [$c_1$,$c_2$,$c_3$,...]}
    \State \Call{Append to}{${Database}\gets{Tree}_i$} \label{alg:training:append_db}
   \EndFor
   \State \textbf{return} $Database$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsubsection{Testing phase}
In the testing phase, an unknown capture is to be assigned a score in comparison with our fingerprint database. The lower the score, the better the match.

A process identical to the training phase is performed on the unknown capture to be tested, with the exception of Algorithm~\ref{alg:training} stage~\ref{alg:training:append_db} --- the capture is not placed in the database.
 
The unknown capture is then compared against the known malware database fingerprint by fingerprint, using three different algorithms – Smoothed KL-Distance, Log Loss and Hamming Loss.

Each of these algorithms returns a numerical value for each pair of fingerprints. These values will be used to classify the capture as malware or malware free.
\section{Datasets and Experimental Setup}
\subsection{Gathering data}
\subsubsection{Malware dataset}

Wireshark captures containing known malware were used. Most were captured by the authors in a sandboxed environment, while additional captures were supplied by a third-party and readily available captures on malware research websites.
The captures supplied by third-party sources were identified by the third-party, and contained many varied traffic interspersed: UDP, TCP, HTTP, POP3 and ICMP to name a few.

Captures from malware that communicates to remote machines via WAN were used.
A total of 26 malware captures were used to create fingerprints, including Asprox (4 captures), Bladabindi (1 capture), Cryptolocker (10 captures), DarkKomet (3 captures), Expiro (3 captures), Sirefef (1 capture) and Winwebsec (4 captures)

Some of the malware tested attempted to obscure itself as standard HTTP traffic (as described with Cryptolocker in section \ref{sec:malwaretraffic}), while some access other TCP ports.

\subsection{Filtering the captures}
Filtering irrelevant entries in the traffic captures required onerous non-automated work.

First, all traffic inside the LAN was removed. WAN IPs were cross-referecned with malware research websites in order to discover if any IPs have already been 'incriminated'.
Similar actions were performed on DNS requests to reveal malicious URLs.

All traffic to non-incriminated URL and IPs was then removed, leaving behind the core behaviour of the malware.

\subsection{Experimental results}

The test setup included training on the malware dataset and control dataset.
The number of centroids was set to 25 for all tests. Empirically, we found this value to preform the best.

A total of 33 raw captures of malware and other background traffic was collected, being captured on different occasions and different machines. These captures will be tested and verified against the fingerprint database created during training.

The same filtering technique was applied to the raw captures to remove internal LAN communication.

The results shown only includes the {\em Smoothed KL distance} method. The other methods examined did not yield sufficiently certain results.

Table \ref{table:testresults} specifies results for comparing an unknown capture versus the fingerprint database using the {\em Smoothed KL Distance method}.
A lower result indicates that the distance between the unknown capture and the fingerprint is smaller, meaning a better match.

Some examples are shown in the ROC graph and Table \ref{table:testresults} below.

Examining the \emph{Cryptolocker $\gamma$} test (the 'worst' performer), while the best match is against a different version of Cryptolocker, there are also good matches against Asprox and Expiro. (See Table \ref{table:testresults} below).
For the other fingerprints, the distance value is much larger ($>3.0$).

Other malware captures shown below display somewhat better results, with identification occuring with a smaller false-positive rate.
With the \emph{Google} test (clean capture with no known malware traffic), all values are above $3.0$, showing that the extracted malware fingerprints are far enough from standard web traffic to avoid a good match result.

Empirically, it was established that results below $3.0$ represent a good match. In future works, this parameter can be used as a classifier rule for deciding if a capture contains malware traffic.

\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a proof of concept application built around the LZ78 tree generation, and a modified KL Distance scheme.
These techniques were applied to timing differences seen in computer network behaviour.
Using the techniques has shown that given a previous timing sequence identified as malware, the proof of concept application  has been able to identify different malware behaviours using only the time difference data.

The system was tested using real-world traffic captures containing interspersed malware traffic, and real-world captures containing no malware traffic.

While the comparison method offered shows good results in the scenario tested, further testing in more elaborate scenarios is needed in order to further identify the shortcomings of this technique.

\subsection{Future work}
To improve detection rates, it is possible to enhance the fingerprint by using more data such as packet header-sizes, session lengths and sizes, etc.

In our work, the Hamming-loss and Log-loss algorithms did not function in a consistent manner. Further experimentation and alterations on these methods should be considered in future works, as they may yet produce better results in some scenarios.
